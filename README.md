## Description 

*Gymtrack* is an application that provides gym owners with a system to manage data related to instructors, members, classes, and reviews left by members.

There are two types of application users: *instructors* and *members*. Instructors are able to log in and add/edit/delete classes. Members are able to log in and book classes as well as leave reviews about classes and/or class instructors.

## Motivations 

We wanted to design a useful application that would facilitate the basic process of creating and booking classes at gyms, and to provide gym members with a platform on which to provide feedback.

As budding web developers, we also approached this project with the objective to build on our understanding of application architectures, in particular, through the implementation of the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
